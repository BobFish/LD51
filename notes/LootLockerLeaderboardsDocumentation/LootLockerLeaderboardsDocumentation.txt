____LootLocker Simple leaderboards documentation____
Easiest way to setup the Leaderboards is to start the room roomLootLockerLeaderboardsGuide
and follow the guide.

If you run into any problems, please join our discord: https://discord.lootlocker.io

The steps in broad terms are these:
1. Create an account at https://www.lootlocker.io
2. Create a new game
3. Create a leaderboard
4. Copy game API key and leaderboardID
5. Run InitializeLootLocker("game api key","game_version","developmentMode","leaderboardID") from any Create event
6. Run LootLockerCallback() from Async - HTTP event.

You can now upload score to your leaderboard by using:
LootLockerSubmitScore("leaderboardID", “scoreYouWantToUpload”);

Change the players name by using:
LootLockerSetPlayerName(“nameThatYouWantToChangeTo”);

Access these variables to fetch the leaderboard data:
LLHighscoresTopFormatted()- Full list of top highscores formatted as:
1. PlayerName       1000
2. PlayerName        300

LootLockerGetHighscoresCentered(“leaderboardID”) - Manually get centered highscores
LootLockerGetHighscoresTop(“leaderboardID”) - Manually get top highscores
LootLockerReset() - Ends the current session and starts a new session with a new player

____Stage vs Live (developmentMode true/false)____
When you release your game, change developmentMode in the Initialize function to false:
LootLockerInitialize("gameAPIkey", "version", "developmentMode", "leaderboardID");
This will remove all of the debug_messages from LootLocker.
You also need to create a new leaderboard for the live environment:
1. Switch to live environment on the leaderboards-screen in the lootlocker dashboard
2. Create a new leaderboard
3. Replace the leaderboardID in the functions to use the new one.


Building your game
All platforms should work right out of the box except HTML5.

HTML5/WebGL
There is currently a bug in Game Maker Studio 2 that can make text apppear as "undefined",
if that happens, you need to build your game with Game Maker Studio 2 Beta (the bug is fixed there).
You also need to add an included file called "LootLockerConfiguration.ini" to the project.
